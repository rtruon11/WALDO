# CaesarBFLambda
 This is a brute force method that uses Frequency Analysis brute force method to crack the caesar cipher
 and recognizes the english language.  The brute force is code from GitHub but the AWS Handler is designed 
 to send a .txt file to an identified S3 bucket.  The Handler method is triggered by an upload to a bucket
 of your choice. Might require changes in order to work for you.
