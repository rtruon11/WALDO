# WALDO
WALDO- (Written Anagraphic Location Decrypted Optically)- This is a web application that will use Amazon AWSto upload an image of written text (.jpg, .png) to an Amazon S3 bucket where Amazon Texttract is used to digitize the coded message into letters, numbers, and symbols into a JSON payload. This payload is then ran through 3 consecutive brute force decryption methods using AWS Lambda and Beanstalk in effort to decode the meaning of the message. This is a student capstone project and the source code within is proprietary to the students involved in the development and implementation.
